This is my first actual Greenfoot game. I co-created this game with a
classmate. We went way overboard on this project compared to the rest
of the class, but I'm ok with that due to the amazing results. All of
the code has been hand coded, not copied from an external source. The 
sprites used in the game have been taken from google.com, and some made
in Fireworks. To view more about myself (Jacob Motta),
