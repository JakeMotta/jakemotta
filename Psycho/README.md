# Psycho

Date: 5-3-2017

Game created for SJSU CS 108 final project. No need for the Firebase and leaderboard, but thought it would be more fun with competition.

Game concept: 
    Game is not necessarily meant to be fun, although I did compensate for this with the leaderboard for some friendly competition (if anyone even cares). Psycho focuses on battling yourself in determining when to click. Anyone can safely click around 3 seconds, but a highscore can't be made by just waiting patiently!
